# similarityANDplotter
Beta version of a spectral difference plotting tool.  Developed for a project, but another tool was used in the end.  It's ugly, so don't get excited.

The biggest issue is that you need to manally add the line styles as you add or remove spectra.  That's the first thing I will fix when I get a moment.
