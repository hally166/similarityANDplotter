# similarityANDplotter
Beta version of a spectral difference plotting tool, it also outputs the similairty matrix.  Developed for a project, but another tool was used in the end.  It's ugly, so don't get excited.

The biggest issue is that you need to manually add the line styles as you add or remove spectra.  That's the first thing I will fix when I get a moment.

flowSpectrum is called, so needs installing if you don't know the max channel.

devtools::install_github('hally166/flowSpectrum')
